1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
*TDM-based networks must transform into packet-based networks to meet the demands of pervasive data-centric applications and services. Packet-based networks not only enable new innovations, services, and business opportunities, they are also the most cost-effective, efficient, and scalable networks for content delivery.*

2. UDP is often refereed to as a connectionless protocol. Why is this?
*UDP is a connectionless protocol. It is known as a datagram protocol because it is analogous to sending a letter where you don't acknowledge receipt. Examples of applications that use connectionless transport services are broadcasting and tftp .*

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
*yes*

4. Can a socket connection application be connected to multiple socket servers?
*yes*

5. Can an application be both a socket server and a socket connection?
*No*

### Observer Pattern:
*is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods*

### Listener:
*function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.*

### Event Handler:
*scripts that are automatically executed when an event occurs*

### Event Driven Programming:
*is a programming paradigm in which the flow of program execution is determined by events*

### Event Loop:
*design pattern that waits for and dispatches events or messages in a program*

### Event Queue:
*is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system.*

### Call Stack:
* is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function*

### Emit/Raise/Trigger:
*to run or fire an event*

### Subscribe:
*gives us the ability to separate different module/component from each other and send/receive messages from them without any tightly coupled relation or even needing to know about each other.Such as promises*

### database:
*is a collection of information that is organized so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated*

## Socket

### WebSocket:
*is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection*

### Socket.IO:
*is a library that enables real-time and full-duplex communication between the Client and the Web servers*

### Differences between WebSocket and socket.io:
- Socket.io It provides the Connection over TCP, while Socket.io is a library to abstract the WebSocket connections.
- WebSocket doesn’t have fallback options, while Socket.io supports fallback.
- WebSocket is the technology, while Socket.io is a library for WebSockets
