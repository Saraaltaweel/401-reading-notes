1. Write the following steps in the correct order:
- *Register your application to get a client_id and client_secret*
- *Ask the client if they want to sign in via a third party*
- *Make a request to a third-party API endpoint*
- *Make a request to the access token endpoint*
- *Receive access token*
- *Redirect to a third party authentication endpoint*
- *Receive authorization code*

2. What can you do with an authorization code?
*An authorization code is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space*

3. What can you do with an access token?
*Add one security level*

4. What’s a benefit of using OAuth instead of your own basic authentication?
*OAuth is a delegated authorization framework for REST/APIs. It enables apps to obtain limited access (scopes) to a user's data without giving away a user's password. It decouples authentication from authorization and supports multiple use cases addressing different device capabilities.*

### Client ID:
*client ID is a unique eight-digit number generated by the depository participants to easily identify their clients*

### Client Secret:
*A client secret is a secret known only to your application and the authorization server. It protects your resources by only granting tokens to authorized requestors.*

### Authentication Endpoint:
*endpoint authentication is an authentication mechanism used to verify the identity of a network's external or remote connecting device. ... This method ensures that only valid or authorized endpoint devices are connected to a network*

### Access Token Endpoint:
*the token endpoint is where apps make a request to get an access token for a user. This section describes how to verify token requests and how to return the appropriate response and errors. Authorization Code. Password Grant.*

### API Endpoint:
*an endpoint can include a URL of a server or service. Each endpoint is the location from which APIs can access the resources they need to carry out their function.*

### Authorization Code:
*is an alphanumeric password that authorizes its user to purchase, sell or transfer items, or to enter information into a security-protected space.*

### Access Token:
*:are the thing that applications use to make API requests on behalf of a user. The access token represents the authorization of a specific application to access specific parts of a user's data. Access tokens must be kept confidential in transit and in storage*

## JSON Web Token (JWT):
 *is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed.*

 ## When should you use JSON Web Tokens?
 - Authorization:
 *This is the most common scenario for using JWT. Once the user is logged in, each subsequent request will include the JWT, allowing the user to access routes, services, and resources that are permitted with that token. Single Sign On is a feature that widely uses JWT nowadays, because of its small overhead and its ability to be easily used across different domains.*

 - Information Exchange:
  *JSON Web Tokens are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties. Because JWTs can be signed—for example, using public/private key pairs—you can be sure the senders are who they say they are. Additionally, as the signature is calculated using the header and the payload, you can also verify that the content hasn't been tampered with.*

  ## JWTs:
   *can be either signed, encrypted or both. If a token is signed, but not encrypted, everyone can read its contents, but when you don't know the private key, you can't change it. Otherwise, the receiver will notice that the signature won't match anymore.*
