## Stack:

### stack:
*is a data structure that consists of Nodes.*
- Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

Common terminology for a stack is:
- Push : *Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed*
- Pop : *Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.*
- Top : *This is the top of the stack.*
- Peek : *When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.*
- IsEmpty : *returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.*
- When you push something to the stack, it becomes the new top
- When you pop something from the stack, you pop the current top and set the next top as top.next.

### Stacks follow these concepts:
*FILO First In Last Out*

## Queue: 
*A Queue is a linear structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO)*

### Queues follow these concepts:
*FIFO First In First Out*
