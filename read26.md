1. Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)
- *Angular*
- *Vue.js*
- *Ember.js*
- *Backbone.js*
- *Node.js*

2. What’s the difference between a framework and a library?
*The technical difference lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library you are in charge of the flow of the application ( you are choosing when and where to call the library), but when you use a framework it is in charge of the flow (provides some places for you to plug in your code but it calls the code you plugged in as needed).*

### Rendering:
*Rendering refers to showing the output in the browser*

### Templates:
*Templating refers to the client side data binding method implemented with the JavaScript language*

### State:
*Describes the status of the entire program or an individual object*

## JSX

- JSX produces React “elements”.

- React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display.

- React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both.

- React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code.

- It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages.

- You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX.

## Component-based UI
*empowers website development teams or UX consulting services providers with more efficiency, consistent GUI, and ease of maintaining any website. It can be of great use when you are playing with large web applications where plenty of UI elements are supposed to be maintained at a time‏*

## ReactJS
*is an open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications*
