1. Describe “The Cloud”:
*refers to servers that are accessed over the Internet, and the software and databases that run on those servers. ... By using cloud computing, users and companies don't have to manage physical servers themselves or run software applications on their own machine*

2. What is a container (as it relates to computers and servers)?
*a container consists of an entire runtime environment: an application, plus all its dependencies, libraries and other binaries, and configuration files needed to run it, bundled into one package*

3. What is auto-scaling?
*Auto Scaling lets you build scaling plans that automate how groups of different resources respond to changes in demand*

4. What is bandwidth?
*is the amount of data that can be transferred from one point to another within a network in a specific amount of time*

5. How do cloud providers compute service costs?
