1. When is Basic Authorization used vs. Bearer Authorization?
### Basic authentication:
*transmits credentials as user ID/password pairs, encoded using base64. The client sends HTTP requests with the Authorization header that contains the word Basic word followed by a space and a base64-encoded string username:password.*

### Bearer authentication:
*(also called token authentication) has security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access to the bearer of this token.” The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources*

2. What does the JSON Web Token package do?
*create access tokens*

3. What considerations should we make when creating and storing a SECRET?
*JSON Web Token is used to send information that can be verified and trusted by means of a digital signature. It comprises a compact and URL-safe JSON object, which is cryptographically signed to verify its authenticity, and which can also be encrypted if the payload contains sensitive information*

### encryption:
 *is the process of scrambling or enciphering data so it can be read only by someone with the means to return it to its original state.*

### token:
*authentication token allows internet users to access applications, services, websites, and application programming interfaces (APIs) without having to enter their login credentials each time they visit.*

### bearer:
*it's a token created for you by the Authentication server. When a user authenticates your application (client) the authentication server then goes and generates for you a Token*

### secret:
*secret is a piece of sensitive information. For example, an API key, password, or any type of credential that you might use to access a confidential system.*

### JSON Web Token:
*is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object.*

## RBAC:
1. role-based access control
2. RBAC is the idea of assigning system access to users based on their role in an organization. It's important to remember that not every employee needs a starring role.
3. users grouped into roles based on common job responsibilities and system access needs

## Benefits:
1. Policy need not be updated when a certain person with a role leaves the organization
2. new user should be able to activate the desire role
3. Revisiting least privilege
4. user in one role ha accesss to subsets of the files
