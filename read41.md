1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
*Ducks is a modular pattern that collocates actions, action types and reducers*

2. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
*makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience*


### redux toolkit slices:
*A function that accepts an initial state, an object full of reducer functions, and a "slice name", and automatically generates action creators and action types that correspond to the reducers and state. This API is the standard approach for writing Redux logic*

### namespace:
*is a group of related elements that each have a unique name or identifier. ... A file path, which uses syntax defined by the operating system, is considered a namespace. For example, C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer is the namespace that describes where Internet Explorer files on a Windows computer*

## React Native
*(also known as RN) is a popular JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase*

*React Native is an open-source mobile application framework created by Facebook, Inc. It is used to develop applications for Android, Android TV, iOS, macOS, tvOS, Web, Windows and UWP by enabling developers to use React's framework along with native platform capabilities*

## Expo
- *Expo is a framework and a platform for universal React applications*.
- *It is a set of tools and services built around React Native and native platforms that help you develop, build, deploy*
- *quickly iterate on iOS, Android, and web apps from the same JavaScript/TypeScript codebase*.

## Ejecting to ExpoKit
*ExpoKit is an Objective-C and Java library that allows you to use the Expo platform and your existing Expo project as part of a larger standard native project -- one that you would normally create using Xcode, Android Studio, or react-native init*
