### Provide links to 3 services or tools that allow you to “mock” an API for development like json-server
  1. [mockoon](https://mockoon.com/)

### Compare and contrast Swagger and APIDoc.js 1 Which HTTP status codes should be sent with each type of (un)successful API call?
 1. Swagger:
 200(ok), ,400(Bad Request) ,401(Authorization information is invalid) ,404(Not found) ,5XX(Unexpected error)

 200(ok), ,400(Bad Request) ,401(4Not Authenticated) ,404(Not found) ,4xx (errors)


 ### Compare and contrast SOAP and ReST
 1. REST:
  *refer to Representational State Transfer , it's an architectural style that defines aset of recommendations for designing loosely coupled applications that use the HTTP protocol for data transmission.*

 *SOAP and REST are two API styles that approach the question of data transmission from a different point of view*

 ### Web Server:
 *is software and hardware that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and other protocols to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web.*

 ### Express:
 *is a free and open-source web application framework for Node. js. It is used for designing and building web applications quickly and easily. Web applications are web apps that you can run on a web browser.*

 ### Routing:
*is a mechanism where HTTP requests are routed to the code that handles them. To put it simply, in the Router you determine what should happen when a user visits a certain page*

 ### WRRC:
 *web request/response cycle traces how a user's request flows through the app.*
