### Linked Lists :
*is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.*

* types of Linked Lists:
  - Singly and Doubly

### Traversal :
1. not able to use a foreach or for loop
2. Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing
3. best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop,allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null.

### Advantages of Linked List :
1. Dynamic Data Structure
2. Insertion and Deletion
3. No Memory Wastage
4. Implementation

### Disadvantages of Linked List :
1. Traversal
2. Memory Usage
3. Reverse Traversing

### Traversal Big O :
1. The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n);because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.
2. The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1);This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.
