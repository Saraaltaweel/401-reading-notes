### Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development
1. TDD reduces the time required for project development.
2. Detailed project documentation.
3. Better program design and higher code quality

### In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?
- beforeEach() is run before each test in a describe afterEach() is run after each test in a describe

### What is one downside of Test Driven Development
- All the members of a team got to do it – As TDD influences the planning of code, it’s recommended that either all the members of a team use TDD or nobody in the least. additionally, to the present, it’s sometimes difficult to justify TDD to the management because they often have the sensation that the implementation of latest features takes longer if developers write code that will not find themselves within the product half the time. It helps if the entire team agrees on the importance of unit tests.

### What’s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?
- classescan call it at runtime, prototype is itself an object instance.

### Why REST?
REST is Easy to Understand and Implement

### functional programming :
*is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in pure mathematical functions style. It is a declarative type of programming style. Its main focus is on “what to solve” in contrast to an imperative style where the main focus is “how to solve”*

### object-oriented programming (OOP) :
*is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods)*

### class :
*Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.*
### super :
*keyword is used to access and call functions on an object's parent. super.prop super[expr]*

### this :
*refer current class instance object*

### Test Driven Development (TDD) :
*is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously. includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code.*

### Jest : 
*is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase*

### Continuous Integration (CI) :
*workflow strategy, development features with modular code in more manageable increments*

### REST :
*is a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. A Web service that follows these guidelines is called RESTful*

### Data Model :
*is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.*

| SQL       | NOSQL |
|-----------|-------|
|Relational Databases    | non-relational or distributed database      |
|have predefined schema     |   have dynamic schema for unstructured data    |
|uses SQL ( structured query language )    |  queries are focused on collection of documents     |

### MongoDB :
*is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema. It has been developed by the founders of DoubleClick, written in C++*
